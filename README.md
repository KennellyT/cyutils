Predicting the Past Cyclus and Cycamore Benchmarking Project
==============================================================

This is a public repository for the shared development of benchmarking
simulation input data representing the past nuclear fuel cycle in the united
states. It is being conducted by undergraduate researchers at the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the Advanced Reactors and Fuel Cycles group.
This work benefits enormously from previous work by Robert Flanagan in the
fleetcomp repository.

Not Ready For Reuse
====================

During development, this work is under sole development by the authors in
preparation for publication in conference proceedings or an archival journal.
