Predicting the Past Cyclus and Cycamore Benchmarking Project
==============================================================

This is a public repository for the shared development of benchmarking
simulation input data representing the past nuclear fuel cycle in the United 
States and Europe. It is being conducted by undergraduate researchers at the 
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the Advanced Reactors and Fuel
Cycles group.This work benefits enormously from previous work by Robert Flanagan 
in the fleetcomp repository.

To view the work, open [region_name].ipynb
To run a simulation for a particular continent, first run:
> python import_pris.py [region] [sim_start_year]

Not Ready For Reuse
====================

During development, this work is under sole development by the authors in
preparation for publication in conference proceedings or an archival journal.
