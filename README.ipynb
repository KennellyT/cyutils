    "In an effort to produce a cross comparison data of the US fleet, _CYCLUS_, an agent-based simulation software was used to simulate and analyze all reactors that have been deployed from 1965. US fleet of nuclear reactors were obtained from a text file and used to specify the reactor name, type, core mass, capacity, deployment date, and closure date.\n",

    "### Obtaining Recipes for Simulation\n",
    "Recipes that describe the composition of spent nuclear fuel for uranium oxide (UOX) at the burn up of 51 GWd/MTHM, was obtained from vision_recipes, a spreadsheet file that contains the results of origen simulations. A `import_data.py`, a python script was used to obtain the necessary isotope and composition data. \n",

    "+  Specify actual burnup for reactors\n",
    "    - Currently, the reactors deployed in Cyclus are all deployed with a burnup of 51 GWd/MTHM. \n",
    "    \n",
    "+  Specify reactor n_assembly_core and batch\n",
    "    - Reactors were deployed in cyclus without the actual number of assemblies per core and batch. The typical values were used for each reactor type (Source needs to be added for the typical values). While the effects of changing these values may not be significant in the outcome of the simulation, specifying such information may benefit the accuracy of the simulation results.\n",

    "+  Apply a similar analysis to different regions such as the EU or in the world\n"
